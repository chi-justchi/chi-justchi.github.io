                        “I used to be the kind of person who really loved traveling”, he said to himself. “Almost… from
                        the age of 18, every summer I would travel around, solo, with my huge backpack. I went to all
                        places and meet all kinds of people. Some of them became friends, while some were more like a
                        nightmare. I was obsessed with this feeling: never knowing what will happen tomorrow, never
                        knowing what kind of people I’m gonna be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every morning, I wake up from an exhausting journey, in a random corner of the world and so far
                        away from home. I almost… don’t know who I am anymore. The person I used to be seems like an
                        image from the past. Everything I used to value doesn’t weigh any importance. The only thing I
                        know for sure is this moment. Just like being born, once more.

                        But… when I aged, eventually, after years and years, this kind of feeling became vaguer. All the
                        blurry faces and endless road. When the night comes, in darkness and silence, old memories came
                        back to me: The life in a small rustic town that I once have… Finally, I understand why people
                        in that small town were contented to have such a simple life.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One day, I will turn around to reflect on my former self and probably will be surprised to find
                        me spending so much time doing completely meaningless things. But I’m not regretting, absolutely
                        no.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think none of us knows what are we doing with our lives. Indeed, no one does. But… just don’t
                        stop wondering in our hearts, whether the road is narrow or wide, is happy or sorrowful. This
                        process is not “suffering”. “Not at all” — he smiled. Without the past, there would be no
                        present, and without the present, there will be no future”.
