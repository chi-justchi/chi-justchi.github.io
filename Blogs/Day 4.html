                <div class="blogcontent">
                    <p>
                        Blindness doesn't mean the eyes are covered, doesn't mean you can't see anything, it's basically
                        the absence of vision. Like the back of a person, one would never have thought of an eye behind
                        their back, because that never existed. Blind people are like that too, they don't think they're
                        defective, they don't know they're defective, and they're not defective. </p>
                    <p>
                        It's strange, isn't it? When I think about this “supposed to be” a normal body. Is this body
                        really normal? Or is it just that there are things that “supposed to have” existed in this body,
                        but never did, so I thought it didn't exist. So, are we defective or not? What is the measure of
                        perfection? Still, does a perfect being exist in this world? And if so, how does the creature
                        know that it is perfect?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It turns out that we are all "blind" in a certain way. Only when we have a broader, more
                        comprehensive view then we realize our "blindness". I think this is the general answer to human
                        existence. As a human, we all gone through birth, old age, sickness and death, a life cycle
                        passes. Our presence is mysterious. How am I here, and for what purpose am I here? We cannot
                        look further, deeper, to the essence of the problem because we do not have that ability. </p>
                    <p>
                        I suddenly recalled about the 4-dimensional space topic that I once read. According to the
                        article, 4-dimensional space is where we can see through the nature of 3-dimensional objects, as
                        if the world we see in 2 dimensions. However, humans can hardly imagine 4-dimensional space,
                        because we do not exist in our lives. We don't feel the need, or have never thought of seeing
                        all the sides of a 3-D object. </p>
                    <p>
                        What, then, is the essence of reality? Is the space we live in real? Or just a human illusion,
                        created by dust. Why do we have limitations, because we cannot see the nature of this world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my opinion, there must be a creature higher than us, the creature that created us in this
                        place. Not when I'm not here, not when not this world is like that. There is a dominant force,
                        creating all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, one thing I suddenly realized, what is perfect? Are these creatures perfect, is there a
                        measure for perfection? Or in fact, being perfect is meaningless. Was every creature made to fit
                        the world around it? Oh my! But what is the world around us? If every organism is defective and
                        its existence adapts to the environment, then what is the environment? I think the environment
                        in which a perfect creature lives must be harsh, because then all their senses must function at
                        their maximum.
                    </p>
                    <p>I should stop here...</p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Accidentally found the article when I was 16 years old, the time when
                        I still liked to be sad and like to think. Now I think differently, at least not the way I used
                        to. But it's also fun to read it again, when I was still carefree like it was just yesterday.
