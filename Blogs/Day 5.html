                        Isn’t it obvious? What is a better way to explore, to see weird things, to get to know a whole
                        new world than to go to the place itself?</p>
                    <p>
                        Don’t get me wrong, I know traveling is one of the most wonderful experiences a human can have:
                        gaining new experiences and perspective, broaden one’s horizon. I has learnt and grow through
                        journeys, but the process doesn’t come as easy as ABC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the previous year, I was very fortunate to have the chance to travel to some places. Both
                        traveling and backpacking. However, the more I go, the more I start to lose interest in
                        traveling. Seeing to a certain amount, all ancient ruins start to look the same, all ancient
                        towns seem to share the same history, and all beautiful nature sceneries begin to bring the same
                        vibe.</p>
                    <p>
                        Aimlessly wandering from places to places, why do I even be here? “Not all those who wander are
                        lost”. But I’m so lost that’s why I’m wandering. </p>
                    <p>
                        On road, contemporary backpackers are rushing from destinations to destinations, trying to
                        fulfill that bucket list of “must-go” places, exploited by parties, and trying out the most
                        “adventurous” activities being offered by the tourism industry to gain immediate external
                        endorsement of “how cool you are”. I have no oppose on them having leisure as a break from
                        conventional lifestyle. In the end, we are all different.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, to me, cultural experience should not be limited to those experience, and “backpacking”
                        should not be the legimitation of the quest for a hedonistic lifestyle. Get to know a city takes
                        much more effort that visiting its most trendy destination.

                        To me, traveling is more than rushing from destination to destination and ending up knowing
                        nothing about the culture, and the people. The more I go, the more I realize it is true that
                        “not important where you are, it is who you are with”. Eventually, I will forget all the
                        breathtaking scenery, all the details of the adventures, but the feelings for the people, and
                        their stories, remain.
